# ESP_IDF_esp_now_example
I wanted to create a simple example to get two ESP32 boards communicating over ESP-NOW using the ESP-IDF by Espressif

HOW TO USE:

. Use get_mac.c to find the MAC address of your receiver board and take note

. In sender.c, edit the receiver_mac array with the MAC address of your receiver

. build, flash and monitor your project
